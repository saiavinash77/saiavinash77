- 👋 Hi, I’m @saiavinash
-🚀 Aspiring AI Engineer | 🐍 Python, 📊 Data Science & 🤖 Generative AI Enthusiast

Hi! I’m a dedicated student passionate about becoming an AI Engineer. I have hands-on experience with Python 🐍 and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn 📈, focusing on data preprocessing and analysis. I’m also exploring frameworks like LangChain 🦜🔗 for building advanced language-based applications.

Although I’m early in my career and haven’t worked on large-scale projects yet, I’m a self-paced learner 📚. My current goals include diving into Generative AI 🧠✨ and related technologies, working on projects that can make a real-world impact 🌍.
